# RequiredFilings.com — Project Context

## What this is
Production website for RequiredFilings.com, a compliance and filing services company in India (company registration, statutory filings, GST, tax, ROC, IPR, ISO, MSME, accounting).

The site is built on top of the Brevon HTML template. 15 pages live as flat HTML in [required-filings/](required-filings/). The template is mostly in place; the real work is replacing template content, branding, and stubs with production content per the content principles.

## Source files
- **Checklist (source of truth):** [production-checklist.md](production-checklist.md)
- **Modernisation build plan:** [build.md](build.md) — 18-phase fix & redesign checklist targeting 85+/100 audit score; tick items there as they complete
- **Content principles:** [buyer-file/content-principles.md](buyer-file/content-principles.md) — every word on the site must follow these
- **Sitemap:** [buyer-file/sitemap-required-filings.md](buyer-file/sitemap-required-filings.md)
- **Pages:** [required-filings/](required-filings/) (flat HTML, edit directly)
- **Assets:** [required-filings/assets/](required-filings/assets/) (img, css, js, scss, webfonts)

## Working rules
- All copy must follow [content-principles.md](buyer-file/content-principles.md): plain English, 12-word sentences max, "you/your", consequences not just services, statements not labels, named CTAs.
- No Brevon template content (Lorem ipsum, "Brevon", "Innovative Solution For Modern Global Businesses", "+8 (666) 123-3562", Envato Melbourne map, fake testimonials) is allowed in production.
- Pages are flat HTML — no build step. Edit `.html` files directly.
- Default Bash tools work; this is Windows, so prefer PowerShell for `.ps1` scripts.

## WIREFRAME LOCK (do not violate)
The wireframe is **locked** as of 2026-06-11, updated 2026-06-29 (preloader + pricing-section removed), updated 2026-07-17 (testimonials, home news section, color-switcher, search popup, header search buttons, offcanvas + footer + team-card social icons all removed).
- **Do not add, remove, reorder, or restructure top-level sections** (`<section>` blocks, header, footer, hero, brand carousel, service grid, about, feature slider, project marquee, FAQ accordion, marquee-2, CTA newsletter, offcanvas).
- **Removed by owner (2026-06-29) — do not reintroduce without asking:** preloader (`<div id="preloader">`), pricing-section (`<section class="pricing-section">` — was on home + 9 service pages).
- **Removed by owner (2026-07-17) — do not reintroduce without asking:**
  - Testimonials — `<section class="testimonial-section">` on `index.html` and `<section class="testimonial-section-3">` on `about.html`. Reason: no real client permissions yet. Reintroduce only when real testimonials land.
  - Home "Latest news" — `<section class="news-section">` removed from `index.html` because there are no real blog posts yet. On `blog.html` the section container is kept but the fake card grid is replaced with a clean "Articles publishing soon" empty state.
  - Color-switcher widget — `<div class="color-palate">` (Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle) removed on every page.
  - Search popup — `<div class="search-popup">` on every page + both header `search-toggler` buttons.
  - Social icons — offcanvas social row, footer social row, all team-card social overlays, and team-card LinkedIn overlays. Reason: no social accounts exist yet. Reintroduce only when real URLs are supplied.
  - Team section — `<section class="team-section-3">` removed from `about.html`. Reason: only two of four slots had real people (founders — already introduced in the founder story above); slots 3–4 were "Profile updating soon" placeholders.
  - Brand carousel — `<div class="brand-section">` (6-logo swiper) removed from `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, and the 8 service pages. Reason: no real client logos exist yet. Reintroduce only when real logos land.
- **Removed by owner (2026-07-19) — do not reintroduce without asking:**
  - Service-hero breadcrumb — `<nav class="rf-service-hero__breadcrumb">` (the "Home / Services / Page name" trail inside the hero) removed from all 19 inner pages (about, services, contact, blog, 404, 4 legal, 10 service pages) plus its CSS rules in `main.css`. Owner did not want the trail displayed. The `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD schema was left in place for SEO.
- **Do not change the column grid** (`col-lg-*`, `col-xl-*`), card counts per row, image aspect-ratio containers, or swiper slide counts.
- **Do not delete or rename existing CSS classes** that the wireframe depends on (`hero-section`, `feature-box-items`, `pricing-box-items`, `news-box-items`, `accordion-box`, `marquee-group`, `swiper-slide`, etc.).
- **Content swaps are fine** — text, image `src`, alt, link href, dropdown options, form `name`/`label`/validation, `<title>`, meta tags, schema, business data, footer addresses.
- **Visually-hidden helpers are fine** (`sr-only`-style labels, honeypot inputs, ARIA, hidden inputs).
- **New pages** (e.g. legal pages) must reuse the same template wireframe (header + service-hero + content section + footer + script bundle) — do not invent a new layout.
- If a change *must* break the wireframe, stop and ask the user first.

## UTF-8 / encoding rule
When editing HTML programmatically, read with `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText($path, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)` and write with `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false))`. The `Get-Content -Raw` / `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` pair will mojibake em-dashes (`—` → `â€"`), curly quotes, and `₹`. Helper scripts `fix-mojibake.ps1` and `fix-alt-text.ps1` at repo root use the safe pattern.

## Intake-checklist data applied 2026-06-11

The client-intake-checklist.docx was returned by **B.Yamini** on 2026-06-27 and applied to the site by `apply-intake-data.ps1`, `apply-pricing-onrequest.ps1`, `apply-intake-data-2.ps1`, and `add-whatsapp.ps1`. The values now baked into every page:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phone (also WhatsApp) | `+91 95027 15353` (E.164 `+919502715353`) |
| Primary email | `srivaarahi.gst@srivaarahi.com` |
| Secondary email (not displayed) | `neelambar@srivaarahi.com` |
| Office / registered address | 1-3-183/40/A/B, Flat #101, Plot #34, Udaya Aditya Apts, Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Telangana - 500080 |
| Office landmark (contact page only) | Opposite Samrakshana School, next to Akshaya Fertility Clinic |
| Jurisdiction city | Hyderabad |
| Working hours | Mon–Sat, 10:00–18:00 IST |

| Authorised capital threshold | ₹1,00,000 |
| Pricing | Every service tier set to "On request" (client opted not to publish rupee amounts) |
| Case studies | Filled with intake numbers — 26+ Pvt Ltd incorporations / 10–15 GST notice resolutions / 87+ Udyam + 4+ ISO certifications |
| Map embed | Address-based Google Maps `q=` URL on contact.html (works without an API key) |
| Team slot 1 | Neelambar Vadrevu, Co-Founder & Managing Director |
| Team slot 2 | Radhika Vadrevu, Co-Founder & Director |

## Still pending after intake (TBD tokens that remain)

Only **three** TBD tokens still appear in the codebase, all blocked on infra decisions:

All TBD tokens were resolved on 2026-07-17:
- `[TBD-form-endpoint]` — resolved. All 10 contact-form `action` attributes now point at the Pabbly webhook (`https://connect.pabbly.com/webhook-listener/webhook/IjU3NjAwNTY5MDYzNzA0M2Qi_pc/IjU3NjcwNTY5MDYzNTA0MzM1MjZhNTUzMDUxMzQi_pc`). Pabbly workflow must be configured client-side to route to (a) fixed email inbox and (b) Google Sheets, per intake.
- `[TBD-newsletter-endpoint]` — resolved. All 19 newsletter-form `action` attributes now point at the same Pabbly webhook. Same routing rules apply.
- `[TBD-map-embed]` — resolved. `contact.html` iframe now points at "Udaya Aditya Apartments, Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Telangana 500080" via Google Maps `q=` URL at zoom 17. Upgrade to official Embed-API URL once Google Business Profile is created.

## Intake fields left blank / pending

These were intake fields the client did not fill — site hides them gracefully or shows tasteful placeholder copy:

- **Founder story** (intake 3.3) — rewritten 2026-07-17. Current copy on `about.html`: two-decade MNC experience → founded RequiredFilings for MSMEs in 2017. Replace with client's longer WhatsApp version when it arrives.
- **Team members 3-4 roles / photos / LinkedIn** (intake 3.6–3.7c) — slot 1 (Neelambar) and slot 2 (Radhika) now confirmed. Slots 3–4 still show "Profile updating soon".
- **Testimonials 1-5** (intake 4.6.1–4.6.5) — all blank. **Section removed 2026-07-17** from home + about per owner instruction. Reintroduce when real permissions land.
- **Social links** (intake 5.x) — no accounts yet. **All social icons removed 2026-07-17** (offcanvas, footer, team-card overlays, LinkedIn overlays). Reintroduce when URLs are supplied.
- **Blog articles** (intake 7.x) — all 5 article Y/N approvals left blank. **Home news section removed 2026-07-17**; `blog.html` shows a clean "Articles publishing soon" empty state.
- **Visual assets** (intake §8) — client "photos shared by 05/07/2026" deadline missed. As of 2026-07-17 the 5 highest-impact image slots were replaced with AI-generated India-context photography via Higgsfield `soul_location`:
  - `assets/img/breadcrumb-bg.jpg` — Indian city skyline at golden hour (used on 19 inner pages as banner background)
  - `assets/img/inner-page/about-image.jpg` — Indian office interior (about page inner hero)
  - `assets/img/og-share.jpg` — deep teal + warm gold abstract (all pages' Open Graph share image)
  - `assets/img/home-1/hero/hero-bg.jpg` — reused breadcrumb-bg (soul_location baked hallucinated location text into the original hero attempt; substituted with the clean skyline until credits refresh)
  - `assets/img/home-1/cta-newsletter.jpg` — reused og-share (same reason as hero-bg)
  - Follow-up: regenerate `hero-bg.jpg` and `cta-newsletter.jpg` with unique clean prompts (try `recraft_v4_1` model — no location-caption artifact) once credits are available. Also still template stock: project marquee (`project-1.jpg`–`project-6.jpg`), home-1/hero foreground assets (`hero-1.png`, `client-img.png`, `box1.png`, `box2.png`), and various feature/service inline images.

## SEO plumbing (added 2026-07-17)

Added in one pass:

- `robots.txt` at site root — allows all crawlers, points at sitemap.
- `sitemap.xml` at site root — 19 URLs with lastmod, changefreq, priority.
- `<link rel="canonical">` on every page — points at the production URL (home canonical strips `index.html`).
- Open Graph + Twitter card meta on every page — `og:type`, `og:site_name`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image` (1200x630), `og:locale=en_IN`; `twitter:card=summary_large_image` + title/description/image.
- JSON-LD Schema.org:
  - Home: `Organization` (founders, CIN, GSTIN, address, contactPoint) + `LocalBusiness` (hours, priceRange, areaServed).
  - Contact: `LocalBusiness` + `BreadcrumbList`.
  - Each of 10 service pages: `Service` (serviceType, description, provider, areaServed) + 3-item `BreadcrumbList`.
  - About, services overview, blog, and 4 legal pages: `BreadcrumbList`.
- `404.html` — cloned from `disclaimer.html` chrome, `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">`, self-canonical, "Page not found." breadcrumb + centered CTAs to home + contact + popular pages. Not listed in sitemap.
- Still pending: `FAQPage` schema on pages with FAQ accordions (needs Q&A extraction per page — deferred).

When any of these arrive, search for the matching pattern (`<a href="#">` for social, "Coming soon" / "Profile updating soon" for team and testimonials, `assets/img/inner-page/team-*` for team photos) and swap in.

## Auto-sync workflow (READ THIS BEFORE MARKING ITEMS DONE)
When you complete a checklist item:
1. Edit [production-checklist.md](production-checklist.md) — change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
2. Run the sync script: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\sync-progress.ps1`
3. The script regenerates the **Progress Snapshot** block below from the checklist.

The Progress Snapshot is auto-generated. Do not edit it by hand — your edits will be overwritten on next sync.

## Modernisation build workflow (READ THIS BEFORE STARTING ANY BUILD PHASE)

[build.md](build.md) is the active modernisation checklist. It is the source of truth for the upgrade from ~49/100 to 85+/100.

**After every successful build step:**
1. Edit [build.md](build.md) — change the completed task's `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
2. No sync script needed — `build.md` is self-contained and does not mirror into CLAUDE.md.
3. If a phase reveals new issues not yet on the list, add them to the relevant phase section in `build.md` before ticking anything.

**Rule:** Never mark a task `[x]` unless the change is confirmed working in the browser or verified in code. Partial implementations stay `[ ]`.
